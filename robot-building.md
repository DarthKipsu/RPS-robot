## Building instructiond for the robotic arm

This is mostly images of my robot, the parts are from my Lego collection and some can not be found from the Lego Mindstorms basic kit. You should use your imagination when building your own arm. :)

The motor moving the arm is connected to the motor port C. Index and middle fingers are conncected to morot port A and the two other fingers to motor port B.

To make it easier for a single motor to lift the entire arm, I have added a sturdy rubber band around the whole thing so that the resting position for the arm is when it's lifted up, not laying down. This will make it easy for the motor to move the whole arm.

Also some rubber bands hold the gears connected to motor in place as I didn't have enough proper sized gears to make it work other way. :) It's important for the gears to stay on the correct straigh lined positions throughout any movement, so to not scew the motor and break it.

A single big gear is moving the index and middle fingers. The fingers themselves use a very simple transmission to be able to open and close them. My main goal was to keep them as light as possible so lifting the arm would be less of a work.

The ring finger is implemented just as the two fingers next to it, but connected to another motor to be able to move it only when paper is played, while the two other fingers are lifted with both paper and scissors.

Thumb is also connected to the motor rotating with paper. Beacuse it's on the other side of the scissors fingers, you need a long power transmission past all the other gears. The thumb is also simpler with movement than the other fingers so you need smaller gears connected to the motor to lift it, so it isn't refracted too much.
